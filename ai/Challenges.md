# AI challenges

## Issues with AI tools

- cli VS IDE use (e.g. claude code VS Claude Desktop)
- Which LLM should we use? (gemini, sonnet, minimax etc)
- Which provider should we use for LLM API use (openrouter, together, official vendors etc)
- Which mcp should we install?
- Should we use an Agents tool (e.g. Jules, Arcade etc)
- RAG Vs VectorDB
- Context ...
- Which md (guides) should I create?
- What AI related files should we track on VCS?
- How to run parallel, sandboxed, automated tasks on the same code/project?
- How to control the token usage and costs?
- Local only VS dual (local + online)
- All the git repositories will get bigger due to the new AI md files added

## Important things in programming on the AI era

> Things that were not so "trendy" some years ago but now seem almost required.

- Documentation in md files (tracked by VCS)
- Code docs (dockblock etc)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
- Scripting (all the things)
- Terminal knowlegde
- Prompting knowledge

## Use AI for these tasks ASAP

- Testing (create, optimize, automate)
- Analyze repository (code, tools, how to, devops, infra, services etc)
- Generate docs for the AI agents (agents.md etc)
- Security audit (e.g. on custom code, secrets, services)
- Automate tasks you already do now (convert to skills, commands, agents etc)
- Review pull requests
- Refactor suggestions
- Repots and evaluation of technical depth
- Try new things an sandboxes
